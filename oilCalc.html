# this jquery mobile webapp attempts to calculate the refractive index of immersion oil needed 
# to correct out spherical aberrations caused by the 
# early or late arrival (compared to the design specification of an objective lens) 
# of photons going in a straight line from an object a few microns deep embedded in 
# mounting media of known refractive index, under a coverslip of known thickness and
# refractive index, and then finally through a thickness of immersion oil of some 
# refractive index. Oil layer thickness is calculated from working distance (WD) of the lens,
# minus the object depth into the mounting medium 
# and in the aberrated case also + design coverslip thickness - real coverslip thickness, 
# This model might not be correct....
# and we also make no mention of numerical aperture of the lens, which is probably
# an important detail. Or does it end up being the same due to trigonometry?
# 
# Rather than using fancy physics with wavefronts and complex equations to work this out, we take a
# simple approach of assuming the spherical aberration is caused by the difference in 
# optical path in ideal designed scenario vs. real abberated situations. 
# (optical path length is the distance the photon "feels" it went, 
# which is just a clever way of saying the time it takes the photon to travel
# dependent on the real distance and the refractive indices of the stuff photons go
# through - that is to say the different speed of light in different media) 
# We only consider photons travelling in a straight line from the object emitting
# light to the lens front surface. 
# So far we make no calculations about photons going in other directions, 
# which is perhaps required. So this might all be totally wrong!!! 
# But it seems to give reasonable results perhaps....

# equations 

# speed in medium = c/n = speed of light / refractive index
# time = distance . n / c

# model:
# time taken for photons to get from sample to lens surface should be the same
# for the reference design of a lens (design spec of coverglass and immersion oil, 
# and sample refractive index)
# AND for some other case with different sample refractive index and/or coverslip 
# and or refractive index immersion oil. 

# simple algebra then tells us the right immersion oil refractive index to use 
# in order to correct a wrong refractive index sample with object at a certain depth
# and some wrong cover glass thickness.

# time designed = timewrongsample

# time = timeinsample + time in cover glass + time in immersion oil

# timeinsample = objectDepthFromCoverslip . sampleRefractiveIndex / c
# times for other layers are calculated the same way: distance.RI/c

# so
# timeDesign = objDepth.RIsampledes + covSlipThickdes.RIcsdes + (WD-objDepth).RIoildes
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                                  c

# likewise
# timeWrongSample = objDepth.RIsamplereal + covSlipThickreal.RIcsreal + (WD-objDepth+covSlipThickdes-covSlipThickreal).RIoilneeded
#   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#                                       c
# multiply out by c, eliminates c, then rearranging to isolate RIoilneeded:

#                 objDepth.RIsampledes + covSlipThickdes.RIcsdes + (WD-objDepth).RIoildes - objDepth.RIsamplereal - covSlipThickreal.RIcsreal
# RIoilneeded  =    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#				(WD-objDepth+covSlipThickdes-covSlipThickreal)

compute corrections for wavelength due to dispersion somehow?
Actually we only need to know the refractive index of the meterials, glass, oil, at different wavelengths.
Abbe number alone doesnt tell us that... but 
optical dispersion graphs can be seen for eg borosilicate crown glass, schott, at 
http://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=glass&book=SCHOTT-BK&page=N-BK7
along with equation for calculating n vs wavelength.
